# Smoke Tests

This guide helps you quickly verify the stack locally using Docker Compose. By default, only the Local poller is enabled, and FTP/SFTP pollers are disabled.

Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Ports available locally: 8080 (app), 9090 (Prometheus), 3000 (Grafana), 2222 (SFTP)

Stack bring-up

- Start the stack in the background
- Wait for the poller health endpoint to report healthy (the worker runs too, but only the poller exposes its health at 8080)

Quick checks

- App health: open http://localhost:8080/health in your browser; you should see "Healthy"
- Prometheus: open http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: open http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin by default)

Local poller smoke

- Place a sample file into the local inbox
  - Source folder on the host: `_data/inboxA`
  - Expected destination: `_data/outboxA`
- Confirm the file appears in `_data/outboxA` shortly after; check poller logs if needed

SFTP service (optional, discovery only for now)

- The compose file includes an SFTP server container based on `atmoz/sftp`
  - Host: localhost
  - Port: 2222
  - Username: demo
  - Password: password
  - Upload directory: `/upload` (mapped to host `_data/sftp-in`)
- IMPORTANT: SFTP poller is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting `Features__EnableSftpPoller=true` on the `poller` service and restarting that service. However, end-to-end file transfer from SFTP to local destinations is not implemented yetâ€”the current processor only supports local filesystem moves. With SFTP polling enabled, you can still verify that files are discovered (via logs/metrics), but transfers will not complete until the new orchestrated processor lands.

Observability pointers

- Metrics (Prometheus): scrape target comes from the app; check counters for poll cycles, files discovered, and errors
- Dashboards (Grafana): basic provisioning is included; expand as the orchestrator and adapters add metrics

Notes

- If any container fails to become healthy, restart the stack after a short pause
- For large-volume tests, prefer placing multiple files into `_data/inboxA` and observe throughput and backoff behavior in the logs

## Orchestrated processor (default)

The orchestrated processor routes files using `Routing` rules and writes to configured `Destinations`. It is enabled by default.

Configure minimal Routing and Destinations via environment variables (examples):

    - `Routing__Rules__0__Name=local-all`
    - `Routing__Rules__0__Protocol=local`
    - `Routing__Rules__0__PathGlob=**/*.*`
    - `Routing__Rules__0__Destinations__0=OutboxA`
    - `Routing__Rules__0__Overwrite=true`
    - `Destinations__Local__0__Name=OutboxA`
    - `Destinations__Local__0__RootPath=./_data/outboxA`

Or appsettings snippet (Development):

    ```json
    {

// no feature flag required; orchestrator is default
"Routing": {
"Rules": [
{
"Name": "local-all",
"Protocol": "local",
"PathGlob": "\*_/_.\*",
"Destinations": ["OutboxA"],
"Overwrite": true
}
]
},
"Destinations": {
"Local": [{ "Name": "OutboxA", "RootPath": "./_data/outboxA" }]
}
}
```

Verify end-to-end

- With orchestrator enabled and rules configured:
  - Place a file in `_data/inboxA` (e.g., `_data/inboxA/sample.txt`).
  - Within a moment, confirm the file appears in `_data/outboxA`.
  - Check logs for a `file.process` span and `file.orchestrate` activity; metrics counters will increment.

Notes

- Orchestrator currently uses the first matching destination only. Multi-destination writes will arrive later.
- Paths in rules/globs are OS-dependent; Windows paths are normalized internally for glob matching.
