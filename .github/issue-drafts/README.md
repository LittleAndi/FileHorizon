# Issue Drafts

This folder contains prepared GitHub issue bodies derived from `docs/PR_FOLLOW_UP.md` roadmap items. When ready to open issues:

1. Copy the markdown content into a new GitHub issue.
2. Apply the listed labels (create if missing):
   - enhancement
   - processing
   - reliability
   - integration
   - idempotency
   - telemetry
   - observability
   - integrity
   - tech-debt
   - performance
   - security
3. Adjust scope or sizing if splitting into smaller deliverables.
4. Link related issues (fan-out metrics, retry policies, idempotency enhancement interplay, etc.).
5. Remove sections that are not applicable once refined.

Each draft includes:

- Summary & Motivation
- Acceptance Criteria
- Implementation Sketch
- Telemetry / Metrics (where relevant)
- Testing Strategy
- Security / Idempotency notes
- Open Questions

Keep this folder lightweight; delete after issues are created if desired.
